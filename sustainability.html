      My journey to sustainable design comes from a love for the natural word and a drive to push sustainability, conservation, and climate change awareness. As a biology major in college, my understanding of the world has been focused on scientific
      inquiry and preserving the natural world. However, through my exploration of the world and the fulfilment of my personal self and style, I discovered ways in which society and the environment are intertwined. I believe that human well-being can
      be advanced while preserving our planet and empowering individuals.

  Clothing is both functional and inspirational. It is a necessary aspect of our life. It can provide protection from the elements, but it can also allow us to express our feelings and inner selves. Clothing is inherently personal, but its
  production links the entire world from beginning to end. The environment too is functional and inspirational. Art for centuries has been influenced by nature, and our world provides us with food, recreation, and natural goods like fabric.
</p>

<p class="susStory">
      My designs and purpose are influenced by my own experiences. In my travels and studies I was inspired by the patterns and unique styles of the traditional dress in Bhutan, the gho and kira. Patterns can clash but still be beautiful and
      functional. In Jordan, a scarf can show cultural and religious pride and belief, and functionally protect an individual from heat and dust. This multidimensionality in the function of clothes should be applied to their design and reuse.
</p>
<p class="susStory">
      My journey in design grew from using my grandmother’s sewing machine and scraps when she no longer was able to sew to interest in ways to impact local production and consumption of clothing. But this vision started with my desire to impact
      people's lives, preserve our planet, and the ability of pieces of clothing to empower my confidence and acceptance of myself and my style.
